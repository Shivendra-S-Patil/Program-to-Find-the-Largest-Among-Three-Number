# Program-to-Find-the-Largest-Among-Three-Number
This Python script is designed to find the largest number among three input numbers.
It includes two sections: one with pre-defined variables and another where the user can input their own numbers. 
The script uses conditional statements (if, elif, and else) to compare the input numbers and determine the largest one. 
The output is a message displaying the largest number.
